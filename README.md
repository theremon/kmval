# kmval
Simple but efficient HTML form (and not only) validation library.

Nothing fancy, no modern patterns, no DI, no chainable functions, no promises (pun intended).
Simple, flexible and robust regex-based validation for HTML forms or other sources of values.
Project will maintained, all ideas welcome.
Minor jQuery dependency will be removed (or made optional) in the near future.
'Proper' documentation is on the way too...
